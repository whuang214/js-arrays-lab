# js-arrays-labs

Welcome to the "js-arrays-labs" repository! This repository contains a series of exercises to practice working with JavaScript arrays.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/whuang214/js-arrays-labs.git
```


2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd js-arrays-labs
```


3. Run the JavaScript file to see the results of the exercises:
```
node arrays-labs.js
```
This will execute the JavaScript code in the `arrays.js` file and display the results of each exercise in the console.


## Exercises

Here are the exercises available in this repository:

1. **Exercise 1:** Define an empty array named `foods`.
2. **Exercise 2:** Add the strings 'pizza' and 'cheeseburger' to the `foods` array such that 'pizza' comes before 'cheeseburger'.
3. **Exercise 3:** Add the string 'taco' to the `foods` array so that 'taco' is the first food in the array.
4. **Exercise 4:** Access the string 'pizza' (based on its known position) in the `foods` array and assign it to a variable named `favFood`.
5. **Exercise 5:** Insert the string 'tofu' in the `foods` array between 'pizza' and 'cheeseburger'.
6. **Exercise 6:** Replace the string 'pizza' in the `foods` array with the strings 'sushi' and 'cupcake'.
7. **Exercise 7:** Use the `slice` method on the `foods` array to create a new array containing 'sushi' and 'cupcake'. Assign the new array to a variable named `yummy`.
8. **Exercise 8:** Use the `indexOf` method on the `foods` array to assign the index of the 'tofu' string to a variable named `soyIdx`.
9. **Exercise 9:** Assign to a variable named `allFoods` the result of joining the strings in the `foods` array, such that the result is the following single string: 'taco -> sushi -> cupcake -> tofu -> cheeseburger'.
10. **Exercise 10:** Assign a boolean to a variable named `hasSoup` depending on whether or not the `foods` array includes the string 'soup'.
11. **Exercise 11:** Use the `forEach` method to iterate through the `nums` array and add each odd number to a new array named `odds`.
12. **Exercise 12:** Use the `forEach` method to iterate through the `nums` array and add each number to the `fizz`, `buzz`, or `fizzbuzz` array based on certain conditions.
13. **Exercise 13:** Assign the last nested array from the `numArrays` array to a variable named `numList`.
14. **Exercise 14:** Access the number 66 from the `numArrays` array and assign it to a variable named `num`.
15. **Exercise 15:** Use nested `forEach` methods to sum up all the numbers contained within the `numArrays` array and assign the total to a variable named `total`.

Feel free to explore the repository and the different exercises available. The JavaScript code and its results can be found in the `arrays.js` file.

Happy coding!
